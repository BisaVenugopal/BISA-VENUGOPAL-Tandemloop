Problem 1: Calculator using class

This task involves designing a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes two double values and a string indicating the operation. I have used object-oriented programming by encapsulating logic within a class. It demonstrates class structure, method usage, and control flow. The program also handles invalid operations and division by zero.

Java Code:
class Calculator {
    double a, b;
    String operation;

    Calculator(double a, double b, String operation) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
        this.operation = operation.toLowerCase();
    }

    double compute() {
        switch (operation) {
            case "add": return a + b;
            case "subtract": return a - b;
            case "multiply": return a * b;
            case "divide": return b != 0 ? a / b : Double.NaN;
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid operation");
        }
    }
}
